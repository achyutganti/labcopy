         <h2>Narrative Detection</h2>

         Narratives have been shown to be an effective way to communicate health risks and promote health behavior change, 
         and given the growing amount of health information being shared on social media, it is crucial to study health-related 
         narratives in social media. However, expert identification of a large number of narrative texts is a time consuming 
         process, and larger scale studies on the use of narratives may be enabled through automatic text classification approaches. 
         Prior work has demonstrated that automatic narrative detection is possible, but modern deep learning approaches 
         have not been used for this task in the domain of online health communities. Therefore, in this paper, we explore 
         the use of deep learning methods to automatically classify the presence of narratives in social media posts, finding 
         that they outperform previously proposed approaches. We also find that in many cases, these models generalize well 
         across posts from different health organizations. Finally, in order to better understand the increase in performance 
         achieved by deep learning models, we use feature analysis techniques to explore the features that most contribute to 
         narrative detection for posts in online health communities.

         <h2>Sarcasm Detection</h2>

         iSarcasmEval is the first shared task to target
         intended sarcasm detection: the data for this
         task was provided and labelled by the authors
         of the texts themselves. Such an approach minimises the downfalls of other methods to collect
         sarcasm data, which rely on distant supervision or third-party annotations. The shared task
         contains two languages, English and Arabic,
         and three subtasks: sarcasm detection, sarcasm
         category classification, and pairwise sarcasm
         identification given a sarcastic sentence and
         its non-sarcastic rephrase. The task received
         submissions from 60 different teams, with the
         sarcasm detection task being the most popular. Most of the participating teams utilised
         pre-trained language models. In this paper, we
         provide an overview of the task, data, and participating teams.

               <h2>Understanding Personal Values</h2>
      
               There are several standard methods used to measure personal values, 
               including the Schwartz Values Survey and the World Values
Survey. While these tools are based on well-established questionnaires,
they are expensive to administer at a large scale and rely on respondents
to self-report their values rather than observing what people actually
choose to write about. We employ a lexicon-based method that can computationally measure personal values on a large scale. Our approach is
not limited to word-counting as we explore and evaluate several alternative approaches to quantifying the usage of value-related themes in
a given document. We apply our methodology to a large blog dataset
comprised of text written by users from different countries around the
world in order to quantify cultural differences in the expression of person
values on blogs. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between the
value themes expressed in blog posts and the values measured for some
of the same countries using the World Values Survey.

               <h2>Finding Optimists and Pessimists on Twitter</h2>
      
               Optimism is linked to various personality factors as well as both psychological
               and physical health, but how does it relate to the way a person tweets? We an-
               alyze the online activity of a set of Twitter users in order to determine how well
               machine learning algorithms can detect a
               person’s outlook on life by reading their
               tweets. A sample of tweets from each user
               is manually annotated in order to establish ground truth labels, and classifiers are
               trained to distinguish between optimistic
               and pessimistic users. Our results suggest that the words in people’s tweets pro-
               vide ample evidence to identify them as
               optimists, pessimists, or somewhere in between. Additionally, several applications
               of these trained models are explored.
